Caption: Run 7-16: resource, pollution, and land yield technologies.
Note: The scale of IOPC has been increased from 1,000 to 2,000 dollars
per person-year.
To increase food production, new agricultural technologies are implemented, augmenting the resource and pollution technologies of the previous run; they increase the land yield LY by a factor of 2 in 1975.
This policy successfully raises the level of food in the short run, but in the long run the high yields cause increased land erosion, which later decreases the available food. After the year 2050 the higher rate of erosion
depresses yields (and thus food per capita FPC) below the values observed in the previous run. As a result, population POP and industrial
output per capita IOPC decline earlier than in Run 7-15, which assumed
no new land yield technologies.

The resource, pollution, and land yield technologies of the previous run
are supplemented in 1975 by an improvement in land maintenance technologies. These new technologies ensure that higher land yields do not
lead to any significant increase in land erosion. The reduced constraints in
the resource, pollution, and agriculture sectors allow population POP and

Caption: Run 7-18: exponential changes in technology.
Here it is assumed that exponentially increasing technologies are able to
postpone indefinitely the effects of the constraints to growth, as modeled
in World3, at no cost and with no delays in development and implementation. The improved technologies tend to reduce per capita resource usage
and pollution generation per unit of agricultural and industrial output at 4
percent per year after 1975. At the same time, land yields tend to increase
at 4 percent per year, with no upper limit and with practically no adverse
side effects such as land erosion. Although industrialization grows exponentially, the rate of removal of land for urban-industrial use decreases to zero by the year 2000. Finally, air pollution is assumed to have no adverse effects on land yield. Under these assumptions, population
reaches 14 billion people in the year 2100 and continues to grow (though
at a slow rate of 0.6 percent per year). Food is in abundance throughout
the run resource usage declines to zero as fewer resources are needed to
sustain output, and industrial output per capita IOPC continues to grow
indefinitely.

Advances in recycling, pollution control, and land yield technologies are
again assumed to be obtainable only at a finite cost. In addition, it is
assumed that the benefits of these technologies will not be realized until
10 years after their initiation. As in Run 7-21, the rising costs, modeled
as a rise in the industrial capital-output ratio ICOR, cause industrial
output per capita IOPC to decline. The added costs incurred by the continued implementation of new technologies even after IOPC has peaked
force IOPC to fall more precipitously than in Run 7-21.

The previous run assumed that new recycling, pollution control, and land
yield technologies are developed in response to a perceived need for
them. Because of the time involved in technological development and
implementation, however, these new technologies were effective only after
a delay. Moreover, their development and implementation required additional capital, which increased the industrial capital-output ratio. In this
run, the assumptions of Run 7-22 are augmented with a societal bias
toward continued growth in industrial output per capita IOPC. Technological policies are implemented only as long as they do not hamper
continued growth in IOPC. This policy is effective in continuing growth
in the short run but counterproductive in the long run: the failure to implement the new technologies causes a significant depletion of resources
and growth is ultimately terminated.
