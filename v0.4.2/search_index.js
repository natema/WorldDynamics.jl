Here, we will implement the third model, in which a growing stock consumes its carrying capacity (this dynamic leads to growth followed by rapid decline). In this case we have only one system, called NonRenewableStock, which contains only one subsystem (that is, one ODE system). The coding of this system consists of four Julia source files, that is, subsystems.jl, initialisations.jl, parameters.jl, and tables.jl (we assume that these files will be included in the directory nonrenewablestock contained in the directory Duggan). The first source file will contain the variable and parameter declarations, and the function specifying the ODE system corresponding to the subsystem. The second and third source files will contain the initial values of the variables and the values of the parameters, respectively. Finally, the fourth source file will contain the tables and the ranges used to interpolate a non-linear function through a collection of linear segments.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#Coding-the-parameters","page":"WorldDynamics tutorial","title":"Coding the parameters","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"WorldDynamics tutorial","title":"WorldDynamics tutorial","text":"The model uses five parameters whose values are specified in a dictionary declared in the file parameters.jl as follows.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"WorldDynamics tutorial","title":"WorldDynamics tutorial","text":"_params = Dict{Symbol,Float64}(\n    :cost_per_investment => 2,\n    :depreciation_rate => 0.05,\n    :fraction_profits_reinvested => 0.12,\n    :revenue_per_unit_extracted => 3,\n    :desired_growth_fraction => 0.07,\n)\ngetparameters() = copy(_params)","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"WorldDynamics tutorial","title":"WorldDynamics tutorial","text":"Note that the function getparameters is exactly the one that has been used above while modifying a parameter.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#Coding-the-initial-values-of-the-variables","page":"WorldDynamics tutorial","title":"Coding the initial values of the variables","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"tutorial/","page":"WorldDynamics tutorial","title":"WorldDynamics tutorial","text":"The model uses 12 variables: two of them requires to specify their initial values.
