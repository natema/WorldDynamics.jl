"""
   `compose(systems::Vector{ODESystem}, connection_eqs::Vector{Equation})`

Return the ODE system obtained by composing the ODE systems in the vector `systems` and by making use of the variable equalities in `connection_eqs`. Normally, each ODE systems in `systems` corresponds to a subsystem of a system in the World3 model, and the variable equalities specify which variables are shared between the subsystems.

   `solve(system::ODESystem, timespan; solver=AutoVern9(Rodas5())`

Return the solution of the `system` ODE system in the `timespan` interval (for the available different ODE system solvers, see the documentation of `DifferentialEquations.jl`).

We use the AutoVern9(Rodas5()) solver since it is among the suggested ones in the documentation of `DifferentialEquations.jl`, and among those we tested, it is the one that works best.

Return the set of variable equalities establishing the connections between the variables in the ODE systems included in the vector `systems`. The function assumes that no two distinct variables have the same name (even if they are defined in different ODE systems).
