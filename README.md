Repository of the Julia code which generates the HTML pages corresponding to a model structured into systems and implemented by using WorldDynamics.jl. Each page contains two HTML tables with all the variables and the parameters of the corresponding system of model.

## An example 

### Setting up the environment

[Install Julia](https://julialang.org/) and clone this repository. After starting the Julia REPL in the repository folder, we can instantiate the environment by running
```jl
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate(".")
julia> Pkg.instantiate()
```
