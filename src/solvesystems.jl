"""
   `compose(systems::Vector{ODESystem}, connection_eqs::Vector{Equation})`

Return the ODE system obtained by composing the ODE systems in the vector `systems` and by making use of the variable equalities in `connection_eqs`. Normally, each ODE systems in `systems` corresponds to a subsystem of a system in the World3 model, and the variable equalities specify which variables are shared between the subsystems.

"""
   `solve(system::ODESystem, timespan; solver=AutoVern9(Rodas5())`

Return the solution of the `system` ODE system in the `timespan` interval (for the available different ODE system solvers, see the documentation of `DifferentialEquations.jl`).

We use the AutoVern9(Rodas5()) solver since it is among the suggested ones in the documentation of `DifferentialEquations.jl`, and among those we tested, it is the one that works best.
